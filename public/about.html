<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Coloured male from South Africa. I have almost a decade of experience within the insurance industry and I am now dabbling into learning how to code.</p>

<p>I grew up in KZN and moved to Gauteng in 2001. I studied a Bcom in Marketing at the university of Johannesburg.
   I also studied to become a welding inspector and attained the qualification of 'Senior welding inspector', in record time,
   from SAIW (The South African Institute of Welding). I then tried my hand at financial planning and I attained a RE5 certificate.
   I am now a test analyst and have bolstered this part of my career with attaining the ISTQB foundation level certificate. I am now trying my hand
   at web development in order to bolster my knowledge and potentially my earnings.
</p>

<p>I am an avid learner as can be seen by the information shown above. I will continue to learn and improve in order to reach the goals that I 
   have set for myself.
